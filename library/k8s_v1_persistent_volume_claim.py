module: k8s_v1_persistent_volume_claim
short_description: Kubernetes PersistentVolumeClaim
description:
- Manage the lifecycle of a persistent_volume_claim object. Supports check mode, and
  attempts to to be idempotent.
version_added: 2.3.0
author: OpenShift (@openshift)
options:
  annotations:
    description:
    - Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may
      be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are
      not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects.
    type: dict
  api_key:
    description:
    - Token used to connect to the API.
  cert_file:
    description:
    - Path to a certificate used to authenticate with the API.
    type: path
  context:
    description:
    - The name of a context found in the Kubernetes config file.
  debug:
    description:
    - Enable debug output from the OpenShift helper. Logging info is written to KubeObjHelper.log
    default: false
    type: bool
  force:
    description:
    - If set to C(True), and I(state) is C(present), an existing object will updated,
      and lists will be replaced, rather than merged.
    default: false
    type: bool
  host:
    description:
    - Provide a URL for acessing the Kubernetes API.
  key_file:
    description:
    - Path to a key file used to authenticate with the API.
    type: path
  kubeconfig:
    description:
    - Path to an existing Kubernetes config file. If not provided, and no other connection
      options are provided, the openshift client will attempt to load the default
      configuration file from I(~/.kube/config.json).
    type: path
  labels:
    description:
    - Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize (scope
      and select) objects. May match selectors of replication controllers and services.
    type: dict
  name:
    description:
    - Name must be unique within a namespace. Is required when creating resources,
      although some resources may allow a client to request the generation of an appropriate
      name automatically. Name is primarily intended for creation idempotence and
      configuration definition. Cannot be updated.
  namespace:
    description:
    - Namespace defines the space within each name must be unique. An empty namespace
      is equivalent to the "default" namespace, but "default" is the canonical representation.
      Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this
      field for those objects will be empty. Must be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot be updated.
  password:
    description:
    - Provide a password for connecting to the API. Use in conjunction with I(username).
  resource_definition:
    description:
    - Provide the YAML definition for the object, bypassing any modules parameters
      intended to define object attributes.
    type: dict
  spec_access_modes:
    description:
    - AccessModes contains the desired access modes the volume should have.
    aliases:
    - access_modes
    type: list
  spec_resources_limits:
    description:
    - Limits describes the maximum amount of compute resources allowed.
    aliases:
    - resources_limits
    type: dict
  spec_resources_requests:
    description:
    - Requests describes the minimum amount of compute resources required. If Requests
      is omitted for a container, it defaults to Limits if that is explicitly specified,
      otherwise to an implementation-defined value.
    aliases:
    - resources_requests
    type: dict
  spec_selector_match_expressions:
    description:
    - matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements
      are ANDed.
    aliases:
    - selector_match_expressions
    type: list
  spec_selector_match_labels:
    description:
    - matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels
      map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is "key",
      the operator is "In", and the values array contains only "value". The requirements
      are ANDed.
    aliases:
    - selector_match_labels
    type: dict
  spec_storage_class_name:
    description:
    - Name of the StorageClass required by the claim.
    aliases:
    - storage_class_name
  spec_volume_name:
    description:
    - VolumeName is the binding reference to the PersistentVolume backing this claim.
    aliases:
    - volume_name
  src:
    description:
    - Provide a path to a file containing the YAML definition of the object. Mutually
      exclusive with I(resource_definition).
    type: path
  ssl_ca_cert:
    description:
    - Path to a CA certificate used to authenticate with the API.
    type: path
  state:
    description:
    - Determines if an object should be created, patched, or deleted. When set to
      C(present), the object will be created, if it does not exist, or patched, if
      parameter values differ from the existing object's attributes, and deleted,
      if set to C(absent). A patch operation results in merging lists and updating
      dictionaries, with lists being merged into a unique set of values. If a list
      contains a dictionary with a I(name) or I(type) attribute, a strategic merge
      is performed, where individual elements with a matching I(name_) or I(type)
      are merged. To force the replacement of lists, set the I(force) option to C(True).
    default: present
    choices:
    - present
    - absent
  username:
    description:
    - Provide a username for connecting to the API.
